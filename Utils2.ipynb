      "examining Scabbers closely. \n",
      "\n",
      "“Er — ” The truth was that Scabbers had never shown \n",
      "the faintest trace of interesting powers. The witch’s \n",

      "Then, quite suddenly, as though following orders, he \n",

      "hurried to the door of the classroom. He opened it a \n",
      "couple of inches. There was no one outside. Very \n",
      "carefully, he edged out of the room and behind the \n",
      "statue of the one-eyed witch. \n",
      "\n",
      "What did he have to do? He pulled out the map again \n",

      "figure was standing exactly where the real Harry was \n",
      "standing, about halfway down the third-floor corridor. \n",
      "Harry watched carefully. His little ink self appeared to \n",

      "pushed himself forward. \n",

      "He slid a considerable way down what felt like a stone \n",

      "wand, muttered, “Lumos\\” and saw that he was in a \n",
      "very narrow, low, earthy passageway. He raised the \n",
      "map, tapped it with the tip of his wand, and \n",
      "muttered, “Mischief managed!” The map went blank \n",
      "at once. He folded it carefully, tucked it inside his \n",
      "robes, then, heart beating fast, both excited and \n",
      "apprehensive, he set off. \n",

      "holding his wand out in front of him. \n",
      "\n",
      "It took ages, but Harry had the thought of \n",
      "Honeydukes to sustain him. After what felt like an \n",

      "\n",
      "He was in a cellar, which was full of wooden crates \n",

      "crept slowly toward the wooden staircase that led \n",
